Sudoku Solutions
================

At the end of Dev Bootcamp week one there is a big challenge to create a working Ruby application which can solve Sudoku.  This was a group project but the code here is the result of my own solo attempt after the group project was completed.

There are a number of Sudoku boards entered as strings.  My solution is capable of solving the first eight, the remaining four cannot be completed by the algorithm.  In this case the program terminates and displays the number of iterations run until no further progress is made. The application is run from the command line and will output completed boards as well as other results.

The sudo_testing.rb file simply tests the code with simple true/false outputs to determine if the code is working as intended.
